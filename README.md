# Project_1: Wiki

## Intro
In this project I created a website similar to Wikipedia. But instead of having pages linked together in the content, I created a website with more structure and easier to use and access wanted content.

## Layout
The pages are categorised under their related topics. Each page can contain multiple tags which each user can choose to attach or increase their rating.

The idea behind this project is so that I can practice

## Tag-weight
This tag-weight system will help display how relevant each tag is to the page, so that other user will know what this page may be about. Tag-weight system will also be used in the search function on this website.

## Search
On the left sidebar, users will be able to search for the page using search through topic or/and tags. The search result will display both pages which exactly matched topic or/and tags combination, as well as other relevant pages in each topic or/and tags chosen.

## Accessibility
Different types of users will have different accessibility to the website.
### Anonymous User
Anonymous user will only be able to view free contents and use search sidebar.
### Free Account
Free account will also be able to create new page under existing topic and rate existing tags.
### Member Account
On top of everything, member account will be able to access member content and attach new tags to the page.
